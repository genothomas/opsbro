# command to run tests
# notice: the nose-cov is used because it is compatible with --processes, but produce a .coverage by process
# so we must combine them in the end
# * -x : stop at first error
# * --exe : allow to launch test py that are executable
# * --process : use 1 sub process
# * --process-timeout: at max 5min for a test to run
# * --process-resttartworker: one sub process by test, to avoid mix between libs
# NOTE: I don't kow why, byt process options are failing, with endless run
script:
  - cd test
  - chmod a+x *sh
  - ./test_suite.sh

#  - nosetests -xv --processes=1 --process-timeout=300 --process-restartworker --with-cov --cov=kunai --exe
#  - coverage combine
#  - cd ..
